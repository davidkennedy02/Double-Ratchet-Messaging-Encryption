Note for use: 

- To run the system, first install any dependencies 
- Then run the server, followed by an instance of 'new_client'

- To create a user, follow the instructions 
- Similarly with logging in

- To create a group, make sure you invite a member that exists! 

- To refresh the state of the chat, hit enter - this will process any sent messages that haven't shown up

- To add a user to a group, write "/invite" in the group and hit enter 
    - You will be asked for the user's name - make sure they exist!

- Please be careful to log out before exiting the terminal :)
